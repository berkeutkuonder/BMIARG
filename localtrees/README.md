# Localtrees

The name of all directories start with r, and the following number indicates the corresponding $\lambda$ value.

Each directory contains 4 sub-directories:

1. true_arg
2. Arbores_map
3. ARGweaver_map
4. SMARTree_map

To provide better visualization, each ARG is generally presented with more than one pdf file.
